Item List:
-

- Big Metal Rod
- Pulse Ammunition
- Frag Grenade
- Scorcher Ammunition
- Big Metal Unit
- Pulse Ammunition (prototype)
- Pulse III Ammunition
- Bronze Pantalettes
- Silver Pantaloons
- Golden Pantaloons


**Additional info:**
- Pulse Ammunition (prototype): Similar to the normal Pulse Ammunition, but lower APR (2 instead of 5) and lower enchantment (+1 instead of +3).
- Big Metal Rod (EE): As in BG2, this is just a crossbow without any bonus to hit/damage and usable by all classes. It does not give classes the ability to equip regular bolts, if they are not already able to.
- Big Metal Rod (IWD2): Has unlocked APR, but no bonus to hit/damage (so APR increases at higher levels). For comparison, standard crossbows in IWD2 do not gain higher APR with character growth, but even non-magical crossbows have big bonuses to hit/damage.
- Big Metal Unit (IWD2): A side effect of the animation change is that selection sounds when clicking the character will change to a creature sound. This change in sound will persist even after removing the armor. I couldn't figure out a workaround, but saving and reloading (with the armor off) will return selection sounds back to normal.
