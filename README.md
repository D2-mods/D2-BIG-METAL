# D2-BIG-METAL
2021-08-22: Just adding a note in case anyone actually sees this. The test release basically works 100% as stated in the readme. I'm still working on some things with this mod, so no idea when a v1.0 will be ready.


GitHub: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-BIG-METAL  
Forum:  
Game version: BG:EE, IWD:EE, IWD2, untested with non-EE BG1/IWD


WHAT THIS MOD DOES:

Adds the Big Metal Unit from BG2 to other IE games. The full set is obtainable in-game in Icewind Dale 1 and 2. The Big Metal Rod and Pulse Ammunition (prototype) are obtainable in BG1. The items are "purchased" (1 gold) from various stores. This actually works pretty well, even though it sounds a bit wierd. The stronger items are only obtainable later in the IWD games. I think they're placed pretty well balance-wise, but obviously, this isn't the mod to use if you're concerned about purity of the game balance.


INSTALLATION:

Copy zipped files to game directory, and run setup-d2-mira to install or uninstall. Component 1 installs the items and component 2 adds them to stores. I made adding to stores a separate component so people who might want to just import the items at the start can skip this step. Mod packages are cross-platform, and were made using ALIEN's Infinity Auto Packager. I don't use Mac/Linux, but installing should be the same as with other mods.


ITEM LIST:

- Big Metal Rod
- Pulse Ammunition
- Frag Grenade
- Scorcher Ammunition
- Big Metal Unit
- Pulse Ammunition (prototype)

NOTE: As in BG2, the Big Metal Rod is just a crossbow without any bonus to hit/damage and usable by all classes (but with a unique icon that sets it apart).

Pulse Ammunition (prototype): This is a version of the in-development Pulse Ammunition that was stolen and sold at the Carnival, before finding its way to Baldur's Gate. "FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY", the label reads. Allows you to shoot small balls of pure energy from the Big Metal Rod.

IWD2 note: A side effect of the animation change (with the armor) is that selection sounds when clicking the character will change to a creature sound. This change in sound will persist even after removing the armor. I couldn't figure out a workaround, but saving and reloading will return selection sounds back to normal.
