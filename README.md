# D2 Mira
Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-Mira/releases  
Installs on: IWD:EE, IWD2, BG:EE, EET


#### Overview:

Adds the Big Metal items from BG2 to other Infinity Engine games. The full set is obtainable in IWD:EE and IWD2. The Rod and Pulse Ammunition (prototype) are added to BG:EE. Some items are sold by merchants and some can be found in various places. The pantaloons are also in the IWD games, but (as of now) aren't needed for getting the Big Metal Unit.


#### Components:

1. Main Component
	- Option 1: Standard Installation - all items are added to stores or containers
	- Option 2: Start with the core "Big Metal" items
2. IWD:EE: Choose revised or vanilla BG2 ammo (default is Revised)


#### Item List:

- Big Metal Rod
- Pulse Ammunition
- Frag Grenade
- Scorcher Ammunition
- Big Metal Unit
- Pulse Ammunition (prototype)
- Pulse III Ammunition
- Bronze Pantalettes
- Silver Pantaloons
- Golden Pantaloons


#### Additional info:
- Pulse Ammunition (prototype): Similar to the normal Pulse Ammunition, but lower APR (2 instead of 5) and lower enchantment (+1 instead of +3).
- Big Metal Rod (EE): As in BG2, this is just a crossbow without any bonus to hit/damage and usable by all classes. It does not give classes the ability to equip regular bolts, if they are not already able to.
- Big Metal Rod (IWD2): Has unlocked APR, but no bonus to hit/damage (so APR increases at higher levels). For comparison, standard crossbows in IWD2 do not gain higher APR with character growth, but even non-magical crossbows have big bonuses to hit/damage.
- Big Metal Unit (IWD2): A side effect of the animation change is that selection sounds when clicking the character will change to a creature sound. This change in sound will persist even after removing the armor. I couldn't figure out a workaround, but saving and reloading (with the armor off) will return selection sounds back to normal.
