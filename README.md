**Trades info (IWDEE, IWD1, IWD2):**
- Big Metal Unit : requires the 3 pantaloons
- Pulse Ammunition : requires the Pulse (prototype)
- Pulse III : requires any lesser Pulse Ammo (regular or prototype)

NOTE: You need to have the Big Metal Rod to get the Pulse Ammo dialogues.


**Known issues:**
- Big Metal Unit (classic IWD1): Does not change appearance. Will appear as a plate mail.
- Big Metal Unit (IWD2): Selection sounds will change to a creature sound, even after removing the armor. Saving and reloading (with the armor off) will return selection sounds back to normal.
