Game version: IWD:EE, IWD2, BG:EE, EET (EEs tested on v2.5/v2.6)


==================================================
WHAT THIS MOD DOES
==================================================
Adds the Big Metal Unit from BG2 to other IE games. The full set is obtainable in IWD:EE and IWD2. The Rod and Pulse Ammunition (prototype) are obtainable in BG:EE. All items are purchased, and get added to various stores. I may expand on certain things in the future. As of v2.0, this mod also rebalances the ammunitions for the IWD games.

Bonus: I also added the Golden/Silver Pantaloons and Bronze Pantalettes to both IWD games. They are extremely expensive and have no purpose at all other than taking up inventory space, but they are there if you want them.


UPDATE:
v2.0
- rebalances the ammunitions (optional for IWD:EE)
- details: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D2-mods/D2-Mira/main/d2-mira/v2.0%20-%20Revised%20ammunition.txt


==================================================
INSTALLATION
==================================================
Extract to game folder and run the setup to install or uninstall. I'm not familiar with Mac/Linux, but installing should be the same as other mods (mod packages are cross-platform).

This mod has 2 components:
1. Installs the items.
2. IWD:EE only: Choose Revised or vanilla BG2 ammo (default is Revised)


==================================================
ITEM LIST
==================================================

Item resource/locations (spoilers): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D2-mods/D2-Mira/main/d2-mira/Item%20locations%20(spoilers).txt

Additional info:
- Pulse Ammunition (prototype): Similar to the normal Pulse Ammunition, but lower APR (2 instead of 5) and lower enchantment (+1 instead of +3).
- Big Metal Rod (EE): As in BG2, this is just a crossbow without any bonus to hit/damage and usable by all classes. It does not give classes the ability to equip regular bolts, if they are not already able to.
- Big Metal Rod (IWD2): Has unlocked APR, but no bonus to hit/damage (so APR increases at higher levels). For comparison, standard crossbows in IWD2 do not gain higher APR with character growth, but even non-magical crossbows have big bonuses to hit/damage.
- Big Metal Unit (IWD2): A side effect of the animation change is that selection sounds when clicking the character will change to a creature sound. This change in sound will persist even after removing the armor. I couldn't figure out a workaround, but saving and reloading (with the armor off) will return selection sounds back to normal.
