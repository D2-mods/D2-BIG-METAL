For IWD:EE, you can choose between revised or vanilla stats. It's a patching component that only affects 3 files added by the mod, so you can install it even mid-game, even if the items are already in your inventory. Notably, the APR bonus is lower, but enchantment level is higher, and Pulse Ammunition is much stronger than vanilla.

For IWD2, the v2.0 ammo is a better fit gameplay-wise with the Big Metal Rod. Both Rod and ammo now have unlocked APR, so if using them together, APR will increase with character growth, and you get a better sense of progression that way as well. It's, at least, viable enough to keep around as an option.
