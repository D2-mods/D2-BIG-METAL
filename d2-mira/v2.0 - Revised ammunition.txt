For IWD:EE, the revision is optional. I added a 3rd component to the install that lets you choose between revised or vanilla ammunition. It's a patching component, that only affects 3 files added by the mod, so you can install it even mid-game, even if the items are already in your inventory. Notably, APR is lowered, but enchantment level is higher, and Pulse Ammunition is much stronger than vanilla. Also note that the ammo types set APR to 3, instead of adding +1 or +2, so that they won't stack with speed crossbows.

For IWD2, the revision is not optional. A direct porting of the items was never going to work well. My hope is that the items are better balanced now, and more importantly (for me), the Big Metal Rod is a better fit, gameplay-wise, with the ammunitions. Both have unlocked APR, so if using them together, APR will increase with character growth, and you get a better sense of progression that way as well. It's, at least, viable enough to keep around as an option.
